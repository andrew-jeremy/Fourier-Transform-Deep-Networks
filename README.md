>>> Reducing-Deep-Network-Complexity-with-Fourier-Transform-Method <<<

Programs for CIFAR and MNIST classification with fully connected networks and Fourier 
transformed inputs for classification. They are all written in python 3.6 syntax with
a Tensorflow processing neuron network engine. To run them on these data sets, which will
automatically be downloaded if there are not present on the computer.:wq
